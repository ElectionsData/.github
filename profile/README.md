## 🗳️ ElectionsData 

ElectionsData is an open API that provides information on elections, candidates, parties, and regions through REST, GraphQL, and UI interfaces. The API is designed to be easy to use and accessible to developers, journalists, researchers, and anyone interested in elections data.

The project consists of two main repositories: [elections-us-backend](https://github.com/ElectionsData/elections-us-backend) and [elections-us-frontend](https://github.com/ElectionsData/elections-us-frontend). The backend repository contains the core API logic, while the frontend repository provides an interactive web interface for users to explore the data.
